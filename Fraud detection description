Credit Card Fraud Detection using Python and Pandas

Project Description:

This project focuses on developing a Credit Card Fraud Detection system using Python, leveraging powerful libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. The primary goal is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the model in real-world scenarios.

Features:

- *Data Loading and Preprocessing:* 
  - Utilizes Pandas to read and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical attributes for optimal model performance.

- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*
  - Performs EDA to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, including the distribution of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions, feature correlations, and visualization of important attributes.

- *Feature Engineering:*
  - Creates new features that enhance the predictive power of the model, such as transaction time intervals, user spending behavior metrics, and anomaly scores.

- *Machine Learning Model:*
  - Implements various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
